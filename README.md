# **Automated Office Workflows:**

OfficeAutos is a suite of tools designed to streamline and automate common administrative and data-handling tasks within an office environment. The project aims to improve efficiency by providing desktop applications built with JavaScript,HTML/CSS[including css libraries] and python for the programming while using Tauri so like a binding cause we are aiming for cross-platform , we are focusing on familiar tech, tech with a strong eco-system so beginners won't get lost and walking with llms will be easier too. we dont want to be like swift here no pun intended 

The core functionality includes file manipulation, data processing, and workflow orchestration, driven by the modular filemovers  and DocX generator template sub-projects.

The projects aims to introduce your everyday office secretaries and what not, to the things he/she could achieve by working with A.I and not just using it.
Why disturb A.I everyday with the same queries when you can just automate, it's eco-friendly and reduces prompt cost, right ? abi am i wrong.
Fear not for we will be pushing updates sha, but hey think of this as a seed leaf.
